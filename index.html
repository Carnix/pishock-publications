		<section id="synopsis">
			<p>
				This is my personal journey and a book intended to help not only myself but every LEO and firefighter who has worn the badge,
				spending countless sleepless nights away from their families. I believe this book will also resonate with our military personnel and anyone who has chosen to serve this great country.
				I have trained with and alongside every branch of our exceptional military. Every military member I've spoken with has told me the same thing: they chose public safety to regain the brotherhood they had lost.
				Servitude is where "it's at," and you either understand that or you don't. To those who serve, I love you and look forward to meeting you all in person someday.
				To those who purposely choose not to embrace the honor of serving, you've truly missed out &mdash; you'll never understand.
